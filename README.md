# theMARTYApp

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), customized for **MARTY — a voice-first, persona-driven AI that turns reflection into action**.

MARTY is designed to help users track patterns, get gentle nudges, and engage in brief, actionable conversations — all without being therapy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see MARTY in action.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx` or other components under `app/`. The app auto-updates as you edit the files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load the **Geist** font for a clean, modern UI.

## Features

- Chat-based journaling with AI reflection
- Pattern recognition and loop detection
- Voice input support
- Cinematic UI and branding
- Investor & Fund pages integrated
